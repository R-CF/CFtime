# Return the number of days in a month given a certain CF calendar

Given a vector of dates as strings in ISO 8601 or UDUNITS format and a
[CFTime](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFtime.md) object, this
function will return a vector of the same length as the dates,
indicating the number of days in the month according to the calendar
specification. If no vector of days is supplied, the function will
return an integer vector of length 12 with the number of days for each
month of the calendar (disregarding the leap day for `standard` and
`julian` calendars).

## Usage

``` r
month_days(t, x = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- t:

  The `CFTime` instance to use.

- x:

  character. An optional vector of dates as strings with format
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. Any time part will be silently ingested.

## Value

A vector indicating the number of days in each month for the vector of
dates supplied as argument `x`. Invalidly specified dates will result in
an `NA` value. If no dates are supplied, the number of days per month
for the calendar as a vector of length 12.

When working with factors generated by
[`CFfactor()`](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFfactor.md), it
is usually better to use
[`CFfactor_units()`](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFfactor_units.md)
as that will consider leap days for non-era factors.
[`CFfactor_units()`](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFfactor_units.md)
can also work with other time periods and calendar units, such as "hours
per month", or "days per season".

## Examples

``` r
dates <- c("2021-11-27", "2021-12-10", "2022-01-14", "2022-02-18")
t <- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01", "standard")
month_days(t, dates)
#> [1] 30 31 31 28

t <- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01", "360_day")
month_days(t, dates)
#> [1] 30 30 30 30

t <- CFtime("days since 1850-01-01", "all_leap")
month_days(t, dates)
#> [1] 30 31 31 29

month_days(t)
#>  [1] 31 29 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31
```

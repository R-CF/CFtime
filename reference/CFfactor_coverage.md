# Coverage of time elements for each factor level

This function calculates the number of time elements, or the relative
coverage, in each level of a factor generated by
[`CFfactor()`](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFfactor.md).

## Usage

``` r
CFfactor_coverage(t, f, coverage = "absolute")
```

## Arguments

- t:

  An instance of
  [CFTime](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFtime.md).

- f:

  factor or list. A factor or a list of factors derived from the
  parameter `t`. The factor or list thereof should generally be
  generated by the function
  [`CFfactor()`](https://r-cf.github.io/CFtime/reference/CFfactor.md).

- coverage:

  "absolute" or "relative".

## Value

If `f` is a factor, a numeric vector with a length equal to the number
of levels in the factor, indicating the number of units from the time
series in `t` contained in each level of the factor when
`coverage = "absolute"` or the proportion of units present relative to
the maximum number when `coverage = "relative"`. If `f` is a list of
factors, a list with each element a numeric vector as above.

## Examples

``` r
t <- CFtime("days since 2001-01-01", "365_day", 0:364)
f <- CFfactor(t, "dekad")
CFfactor_coverage(t, f, "absolute")
#>  [1] 10 10 11 10 10  8 10 10 11 10 10 10 10 10 11 10 10 10 10 10 11 10 10 11 10
#> [26] 10 10 10 10 11 10 10 10 10 10 11
```

#' Create a vector of character strings that represent CF timestamps
#'
#' The CFts instance typically contains a vector of offsets from an origin. This
#' function generates a vector of character strings that represent the date
#' and/or time in a selectable combination for each offset.
#'
#' The character strings use the format `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssÂ±hh:mm`, depending
#' on the `format` specifier. The date in the string is not necessarily
#' compatible with `POSIXt` - in the `360_day` calendar `2017-02-30` is valid
#' and `2017-03-31` is not.
#'
#' @param cfts CFts. The CFts instance that contains the offsets to use.
#' @param format character. An atomic string with either of the values "date",
#' "time", "timestamp".
#'
#' @returns A character vector where each element represents a moment in time
#' according to the `format` specifier.

#' datum <- CFdatum("hours since 2020-01-01")
#' ts <- CFts(datum, seq(0, 24, by = 0.25))
#' x <- CFtimestamp(ts, "timestamp")

  if (!(format %in% c("date", "time", "timestamp"))) stop("Format specifier not recognized")

  x <- cfts@ymds
  out <- switch(format,

#' Formatting of time strings from time elements

#' Create a factor from the offsets in an CFts instance
#'
#' With this function a factor can be generated for the time series, or a part
#' thereof, contained in the `CFts` instance. This is specifically interesting
#' for creating factors from the date part of the time series that aggregate the
#' time series into longer time periods (such as month) that can then be used to
#' process daily CF data sets using, for instance, `tapply()`.
#'
#' The factor will respect the calendar of the datum that the time series is
#' built on. For `period`s longer than a day this will result in a factor where
#' the calendar is no longer relevant (because calendars impacts days, not
#' dekads, months or seasons).
#'
#' The factor will be generated in the order of the offsets of the `CFts`
#' instance. While typical CF-compliant data sources use ordered time series
#' there is, however, no guarantee that the factor is ordered as multiple `CFts`
#' objects may have been merged out of order.
#'
#' If the `epoch` parameter is specified, either as a vector of years to include
#' in the factor, or as a list of such vectors, the factor will only consider
#' those values in the time series that fall within the list of years, inclusive
#' of boundary values. Other values in the factor will be set to `NA`. The years
#' need not be contiguous, within a single vector or among the list items, or in
#' order.
#'
#' The following periods are supported by this function:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `year`, the year of each offset is returned as "YYYY".
#'   \item `season`, the meteorological season of each offset is returned as
#'   "DJF", "MAM", "JJA" or "SON", preceeded by "YYYY-" if no `epoch` is
#'   specified. Note that December dates are labeled as belonging to the
#'   subsequent year, so the date "2020-12-01" yields "2021-DJF". This implies
#'   that for standard CMIP files having one or more full years of data the
#'   first season will have data for the first two months (January and
#'   February), while the final season will have only a single month of data
#'   (December).
#'   \item `month`, the month of each offset is returned as "01" to
#'   "12", preceeded by "YYYY-" if no `epoch` is specified. This is the default
#'   period.
#'   \item `dekad`, ten-day periods are returned as
#'   "Dxx", where xx runs from "01" to "36", preceeded by "YYYY" if no `epoch`
#'   is specified. Each month is subdivided in dekads as follows: 1- days 01 -
#'   10; 2- days 11 - 20; 3- remainder of the month.
#'   \item `day`, the month and day of each offset are returned as "MM-DD",
#'   preceeded by "YYYY-" if no `epoch` is specified.
#' }
#'
#' It is not possible to create a factor for a period that is shorter than the
#' temporal resolution of the source data set from which the `cfts` argument
#' derives. As an example, if the source data set has monthly data, a dekad or
#' day factor cannot be created.
#'
#' Creating factors for other periods is not supported by this function. Factors
#' based on the timestamp information and not dependent on the calendar can
#' trivially be constructed from the output of the `CFtimestamp()` function.
#'
#' @param cfts CFts. An atomic instance of the `CFts` class whose offsets will
#'   be used to construct the factor.
#' @param period character. An atomic character string with one of the values
#'   "year", "season", "month" (the default), "dekad" or "day".
#' @param epoch vector or list, optional. Vector of years for which to construct
#'   the factor, or a list whose elements are each a vector of years. If `epoch`
#'   is not specified, the factor will use the entire time series for the
#'   factor.
#'
#' @returns If `epoch` is a single vector or not specified, a factor with a
#'   length equal to the number of offsets in `cfts`. If `epoch` is a list, a
#'   list with the same number of elements and names as `epoch`, each containing
#'   a factor. Elements in the factor will be set to `NA` for time series values
#'   outside of the range of specified years.

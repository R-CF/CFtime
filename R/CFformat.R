#' Create a vector of character strings that represent CF timestamps
#'
#' The CFts instance typically contains a vector of offsets from an origin. This
#' function generates a vector of character strings that represent the date
#' and/or time in a selectable combination for each offset.
#'
#' The character strings use the format `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssÂ±hh:mm`, depending
#' on the `format` specifier. The date in the string is not necessarily
#' compatible with `POSIXt` - in the `360_day` calendar `2017-02-30` is valid
#' and `2017-03-31` is not.
#'
#' @param cfts CFts. The CFts instance that contains the offsets to use.
#' @param format character. An atomic string with either of the values "date",
#' "time", "timestamp".
#'
#' @return A character vector where each element represents a moment in time
#' according to the `format` specifier.

#' x <- CFtimestamp(ts, "timestamp")

#' Create a factor from the offsets in an CFts instance
#'
#' With this function a factor can be generated for the time series contained in
#' the `CFts` instance. This is specifically interesting for creating factors
#' from the date part of the time series that aggregate the time series into
#' longer time periods (such as month) that can then be used to process daily CF
#' data sets using, for instance, `tapply()`. The factor will respect the
#' calendar of the datum that the time series is built on. For `period`s larger
#' than a day this will result in a factor where the calendar is no longer
#' relevant (because calendars impacts days, not weeks or months).
#'
#' The factor will be generated in the order of the offsets of the `CFts`
#' instance. While typical CF-compliant data sources use ordered time series
#' there is, however, no guarantee that the factor is ordered as
#' multiple `CFts` objects may have been merged out of order.
#'
#' The following periods are supported by this function:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `year`, the year of each offset is returned as "YYYY".
#'   \item `season`, the meteorological season of each offset is returned as
#'   "YYYY-DJF", "YYYY-MAM", "YYYY-JJA" or "YYYY-SON". Note that December dates
#'   are labeled as belonging to the subsequent year, so the date "2020-12-01"
#'   yields "2021-DJF". This implies that for standard CMIP files having one or
#'   more full years of data the first season will have data for the first two
#'   months (January and February), while the final season will have only a
#'   single month of data (December).
#'   \item `month`, the year and month of each offset are returned as "YYYY-MM".
#'   \item `dekad`, ten-day periods for each year and month are returned as
#'   "YYYYDxx", where xx runs from "01" to "36". Each month is subdivided in
#'   dekads as follows: 1- days 01 - 10; 2- days 11 - 20; 3- remainder of the
#'   month.
#' }
#'
#' It is not possible to create a factor for a period that is shorter than the
#' temporal resolution of the source dataset from which the CFts instance
#' derives. As an example, if the source dataset has monthly data, a dekad
#' factor cannot be created.
#'
#' Creating factors for other periods is not supported by this function. Factors
#' based on the timestamp information and not dependent on the calendar can
#' trivially be constructed from the output of the `CFtimestamp()` function.
#'
#' @param cfts CFts. An atomic instance of the `CFts` class whose offsets will
#' be used to construct the factor.
#' @param period character. An atomic character string with one of the values
#' "year", "season", "month" or "dekad".
#'
#' @return A factor with a length equal to the number of offsets in `cfts`.

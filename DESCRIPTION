Description: Support for all calendars as specified in the
    Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions for climate and forecasting 
    data. The CF Metadata Conventions is widely
    used for distributing files with climate observations or projections,
    including the CMIP data used by climate change scientists and the IPCC. This 
    package specifically allows the user to work with any of the CF-compliant 
    calendars (many of which are not compliant with POSIXt).

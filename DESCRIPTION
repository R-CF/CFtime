Description: Support for dates and times as specified in the
    CF convention for climate and forecasting data. The CF convention is widely
    used for distributing files with climate observations or predictions,
    including the CMIP data used by climate change scientists and the IPCC. This 
    package specifically allows the user to work with any of the CF-compliant 
    calendars (many of which are not compliant with POSIXt).

## Climate change models and calendars

Around the world, many climate change models are being developed (100+) under
the umbrella of the [World Climate Research Programme](https://www.wcrp-climate.org) to assess the
rate of climate change. Published data is generally publicly available to download for
research and other (non-commercial) purposes through partner organizations in 
the Earth Systems Grid Federation.

The data are all formatted to comply with the [CF Metadata Conventions](http://cfconventions.org),
a set of standards to support standardization among research groups and published
data sets. These conventions greatly facilitate use and analysis of the climate
projections because standard processing work flows (should) work across
the various data sets.

On the flip side, the CF Metadata Conventions needs to cater to a wide range of
modeling requirements and that means that some of the areas covered by the standards are
more complex than might be assumed. One of those areas is the temporal dimension
of the data sets. The CF Metadata Conventions supports no less than nine different
calendar definitions, that, upon analysis, fall into five distinct calendars
(from the perspective of computation of climate projections):

 - `standard` or `gregorian`: The international civil calendar that is in common use in 
 many countries around the world, adopted by edict of Pope Gregory XIII in 1582
 and in effect from 15 October of that year. The `proleptic_gregorian` calendar
 is the same as the `gregorian` calendar, but with validity
 extended to periods prior to `1582-10-15`.
 - `julian`: Adopted in the year 45 BCE, every fourth year is a leap year. 
 Originally, the julian calendar did not have a monotonically increasing year 
 assigned to it and there are indeed several julian calendars in use around the
 world today with different years assigned to them. Common interpretation
 is currently that the year is the same as that of the standard calendar. The 
 julian calendar is currently 13 days behind the gregorian calendar.
 - `365_day` or `noleap`: No years have a leap day.
 - `366_day` or `all_leap`: All years have a leap day.
 - `360_day`: Every year has 12 months of 30 days each.

The three latter calendars are specific to the CF Metadata Conventions to
reduce computational complexities of working with dates. These three, and the
julian calendar, are not compliant with the standard `POSIXt` date/time
facilities in `R` and using standard date/time procedures would quickly lead to
problems. In the below code snippet, the date of `1949-12-01` is the *datum*
from which other dates are calculated. When adding 43,289 days to this *datum*
for a data set that uses the `360_day` calendar, that should yield a date some 120 
years after the *datum*:

```{r}
# POSIXt calculations on a standard calendar - INCORRECT
as.Date("1949-12-01") + 43289

# CFtime calculation on a "360_day" calendar - CORRECT
# See below examples for details on the two functions
CFtimestamp(CFtime("days since 1949-12-01", "360_day", 43289))
```

Using standard `POSIXt` calculations gives a result that is about 21 months off
from the correct date - obviously an undesirable situation. This example is far
from artificial: `1949-12-01` is the datum for all CORDEX data, covering the 
period 1951 - 2005 for historical experiments and the period 2006 - 2100 for RCP 
experiments (with some deviation between data sets), and several models used in 
the CORDEX set use the `360_day` calendar. The `365_day` or `noleap` calendar 
deviates by about 1 day every 4 years (disregarding centurial years), or about 
24 days in a century. The `366_day` or  `all_leap` calendar deviates by about 3 
days every 4 years, or about 76 days in a century.

The `CFtime` package deals with the complexity of the different calendars allowed
by the CF Metadata Conventions. It properly formats dates and times (even oddball
dates like `2070-02-30`) and it can generate calendar-aware factors for further 
processing of the data.

## Using CFtime to deal with calendars

Data sets that are compliant with the CF Metadata Conventions always include a 
*datum*, a specific point in time in reference to a specified *calendar*, from 
which other points in time are calculated by adding a specified *offset* of a
certain *unit*. This approach is encapsulated in the `CFtime` package by the S4 
class `CFtime`.

```{r}
# Create a CF time object from a definition strinmg, a calendar and some offsets
cf <- CFtime("days since 1949-12-01", "360_day", 19830:90029)
cf
```

The `CFtime()` function takes a *datum* description (which is actually a unit -
"days" - in reference to a datum - "1949-12-01"), a calendar description, and a 
vector of *offsets* from that datum. Once a `CFtime` instance is created its 
datum and calendar cannot be changed anymore. Offsets may be added.

In practice, these parameters will be taken from the data set of interest. CF Metadata
Conventions require data sets to be in the netCDF format, with all metadata
describing the data set included in a single file. Not surprisingly, all of the
pieces are contained in the mandatory `time` dimension of the file. The process
then becomes as follows, for a CMIP6 file of daily precipitation:

```{r}
# Opening a data file that is included with the package and showing some attributes.
# Usually you would `list.files()` on a directory of your choice.
nc <- nc_open(list.files(path = system.file("extdata", package = "CFtime"), full.names = TRUE)[1])
attrs <- ncatt_get(nc, "")
attrs$title
experiment <- attrs$experiment_id
experiment

# Create the CFtime instance from the metadata in the file.
cf <- CFtime(nc$dim$time$units, nc$dim$time$calendar, nc$dim$time$vals)
cf
```

`nc$dim$time$units` and `nc$dim$time$calendar` are required attributes of the `time`
dimension in the netCDF file, and `nc$dim$time$vals` are the offset values, or
`dimnames()` in `R` terms, for the `time` dimension of the data.

The above example (and others in this vignette) use the `ncdf4` package. If you 
are using the `RNetCDF` package, creating a `CFtime` instance goes like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
nc <- open.nc(list.files(path = system.file("extdata", package = "CFtime"), full.names = TRUE)[1])
cf <- CFtime(att.get.nc(nc, "time", "units"), att.get.nc(nc, "time", "calendar"), var.get.nc(nc, "time"))
```

The corresponding character representations of the time series can be easily generated:

```{r}
dates <- CFtimestamp(cf, format = "date")
dates[1:10]
```

...as well as the full range of the time series:

```{r}
CFrange(cf)
```

Note that in this latter case, if any of the timestamps in the time series have a time that is
other than `00:00:00` then the time of the extremes of the time series is also
displayed. This is a common occurrence because the CF Metadata
Conventions prescribe that the middle of the time period (month, day, etc) is recorded, which 
for months with 31 days would be something like `2005-01-15T12:00:00`.

## Processing climate projections

Individual files containing climate projections contain global, regional or local
data, typically on a rectangular latitude-longitude grid, for a single parameter
such as "near-surface temperature", and for a number of time steps. An analysis
workflow then consists of a number of steps:

 - Download the appropriate data files for your desired combination of model, experiment, realization,
 geography, time range, parameter, ... (called a "data suite" henceforth). If your 
 analysis involves multiple parameters (such as temperature and precipitation to 
 estimate crop productivity), repeat the process for all parameters. If you want 
 to make a multi-model ensemble to reduce model bias, repeat again for all desired model, 
 experiment and realization combinations ("ensemble member"). You end up having 
 one or more data suites to work with.
 - Take all files in a data suite and extract the data. Process the data in the 
 data suite. Since the data are (mostly) 3-dimensional arrays, this will involve 
 binding the arrays on the right dimension and then do something like 
 `apply(data, 1:2, tapply, f, fun)` (following the CF Metadata Conventions,
 dimensions 1 and 2 are "longitude" and "latitude", respectively; the third 
 dimension is "time"). Repeat for the data suite for each ensemble member.
 - Combine the above results as your workflow requires. Frequently this involves 
 computing "anomalies": ratio the data for one or more future periods to a 
 baseline period. Repeat for each ensemble member.
 - Construct the multi-model ensemble from the individual ensemble members.
 
Apart from the first step of obtaining the data, the steps lend themselves well
to automation. The catch, however, is in the factor `f` to use with `tapply()`.
The different models (in your ensemble) use different calendars, meaning that
different factors are required. The CFtime package can help out.

The `CFfactor()` function produces a factor that respects the calendar of the
data files. The function comes in two operating modes:

 - Plain vanilla mode produces a factor for a time period across the entire
 time series. The factor level includes the year. This would be useful to calculate 
 mean temperature for every month in every year, for instance.
 - When one or more "epochs" (periods of interest) are provided, the factor level 
 no longer includes the year and can be used to calculate, for instance, the mean
 temperature per period of interest in the epoch (e.g. average March temperature
 in the epoch 2041-2060).
 
```{r}
# Create a dekad factor for the whole `cf` time series that was created above
dek <- CFfactor(cf, "dekad")
str(dek)

# Create monthly factors for a baseline epoch and early, mid and late 21st century epochs
baseline <- CFfactor(cf, epoch = 1991:2020)
future <- CFfactor(cf, epoch = list(early = 2021:2040, mid = 2041:2060, late = 2061:2080))
str(baseline)
str(future)
```

For the "epoch" version, there are two interesting things to note here:

 - The epochs do not have to coincide with the boundaries of the time series. In the 
 example above, the time series starts in 2015, while the baseline epoch is from 1991.
 Obviously, the number of time steps from the time series that then fall within 
 this epoch will then be reduced.
 - The factor is always of the same length as the time series, with `NA` values
 where the time series values are not falling in the epoch. This ensures that the
 factor is compatible with the data set which the time series describes, such
 that functions like `tapply()` will not throw an error.
 
There are five periods defined for `CFfactor()`:

 - `year`, to summarize data to yearly timescales
 - `season`, the meteorological seasons. Note that the month of December will be
 added to the months of January and February of the following year, so the date 
 "2020-12-01" yields the factor value "2021-DJF".
 - `month`, monthly summeries, the default period.
 - `dekad`, 10-day period. Each month is subdivided in dekads as follows: (1) 
 days 01 - 10; (2) days 11 - 20; (3) remainder of the month.
 - 'day`, to summarize sub-daily data.
 
Building on the examples above of opening a file, creating a `CFtime` instance
and a suitable factor for one data suite, here daily rainfall, the actual
processing of the data into precipitation anomalies for 3 periods relative to a
baseline period could look like this:

```{r}
# Read the data from the netCDF file.
# Keep degenerate dimensions so that we have a predictable data structure: 3-dimensional array.
# Converts units of kg m-2 s-1 to mm/day.
pr <- ncvar_get(nc, "pr", collapse_degen = FALSE) * 86400

# Assign dimnames(), optional.
dimnames(pr) <- list(nc$dim$lon$vals, nc$dim$lat$vals, CFtimestamp(cf))

nc_close(nc)

# Calculate the daily average precipitation per month for the baseline period
# and the three future epochs.
pr_base <- apply(pr, 1:2, tapply, baseline, mean)                         # an array
pr_future <- lapply(future, function(f) apply(pr, 1:2, tapply, f, mean))  # a list of arrays

# Calculate the precipitation anomalies for the future epochs against the baseline.
# Working with daily averages per month so we can simply subtract and then multiply by days 
# per month for the CF calendar.
ano <- lapply(pr_future, function(x) (x - pr_base) * CFmonth_days(cf))

# Plot the results
plot(1:12, ano$early[,1,1], type = "o", col = "blue", ylim = c(-50, 40), xlim = c(1, 12), 
     main = paste0("Hamilton, New Zealand\n", experiment), 
     xlab = "month", ylab = "Precipitation anomaly (mm)")
lines(1:12, ano$mid[,1,1], type = "o", col = "green")
lines(1:12, ano$late[,1,1], type = "o", col = "red")
```

Looks like Hadley will be needing rubber boots in spring and autumn back home!

The interesting feature, working from opening the netCDF file down to plotting, is that
the specifics of the CF calendar that the data suite uses do not have to be considered
anywhere in the processing workflow: the `CFtime` package provides the functionality.
Data suites using another CF calendar are processed exactly the same:

```{r}
nc <- nc_open(list.files(path = system.file("extdata", package = "CFtime"), full.names = TRUE)[2])
cf <- CFtime(nc$dim$time$units, nc$dim$time$calendar, nc$dim$time$vals)
# Note that `cf` has a different CF calendar

baseline <- CFfactor(cf, epoch = 1991:2020)
future <- CFfactor(cf, epoch = list(early = 2021:2040, mid = 2041:2060, late = 2061:2080))

pr <- ncvar_get(nc, "pr", collapse_degen = FALSE) * 86400
nc_close(nc)

pr_base <- apply(pr, 1:2, tapply, baseline, mean)
pr_future <- lapply(future, function(f) apply(pr, 1:2, tapply, f, mean))
ano <- lapply(pr_future, function(x) (x - pr_base) * CFmonth_days(cf))
```

## Working with multiple files in a single data suite

Due to the large size of typical climate projection data files, it is
common to have a data suite that is contained in multiple files. A case in point
is the CORDEX data set which breaks up the experiment period of 2006 - 2100 into
19 files of 5 years each, with each file covering a single parameter (temperature,
precipitation, etc) over an entire domain (such as Europe, South Asia, Central 
America and the Caribbean, etc). The CFtime package can streamline processing of
such multi-file data suites as well.

Assuming that you have your CORDEX files in a directory on disk, organized by domain
and other properties such as the variable, GCM/RCM combination, experiment, etc, 
the process of preparing the files for processing could be encoded in a function 
as below. The argument `fn` is a list of file names to process, and `var` is the
variable contained in the files. (There are no checks on argument sanity here, 
which should really be included. This function only makes sense for a single
[domain, GCM/RCM, experiment, variable] combination. Also be aware of data size,
CORDEX files are huge and stitching all domain data together will easily exhaust
available memory and it may thus lead to very large swap files and very poor 
performance.)

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ncdf4)
library(abind)

prepare_CORDEX <- function(fn, var) {
  offsets <- vector("list", length(fn))
  data <- vector("list", length(fn))
  for (i in 1:length(fn)) {
    nc <- nc_open(fn[i])
    if (i == 1) 
      # Create an "empty" CFtime object, without elements
      cf <- CFtime(nc$dim$time$units, nc$dim$time$calendar)
    
    # Make lists of all datum offsets and data arrays
    offsets[[i]] <- as.vector(nc$dim$time$vals)
    data[[i]] <- ncvar_get(nc, var, 
                           start = c(10, 10, 1), count = c(100, 100, -1), # spatial subsetting
                           collapse_degen = FALSE)
    
    nc_close(nc)
  }
  
  # Create a list for output with the CFtime instance assigned the offsets and
  # the data bound in a single 3-dimensional array
  list(CFtime = cf + unlist(offsets), data = abind(data, along = 3))
}
```

Calling this function like `prepare_CORDEX(list.files(path = "~/CC/CORDEX/CAM", 
pattern = "^pr.*\\.nc$", full.names = TRUE), "pr")` will yield a list of netCDF
files with precipitation data, with the resulting `CFtime` instance
describing the full temporal extent covered by the data files, as well as the
data bound on the temporal dimension, ready for further processing.

When working like this it is imperative that the offsets and the data arrays are
added to their final structures *in exactly the same order*. It is not necessary
that the offsets (and the data) themselves are in order, but the correspondence
between offsets and data needs to be maintained. (`list.files()` produces a list
in alphabetical order by default, which for most climate projection files
produces offsets in chronological order.)

## Final observations

 - This package is intended to facilitate processing of climate projection
 data. It is not a full implementation of the CF Metadata Conventions "time"
 component.
 - In parsing and deparsing of offsets and timestamps, data is rounded to
 milli-second precision. When using units of "days" or "hours", this may lead to
 some loss of precision due to rounding errors. If milli-second precision is 
 required, use a unit of "seconds". The authors have no knowledge of published
 climate projection data that requires milli-second precision so for the
 intended use of the package this issue is marginal.

\title{Create a vector of character strings that represent CF timestamps}
\usage{
CFtimestamp(cfts, format = "date")
}
\arguments{
\item{cfts}{CFts. The \code{CFts} instance that contains the offsets to use.}

\item{format}{character. An atomic string with either of the values "date",
"time", "timestamp".}
}
\value{
A character vector where each element represents a moment in time
according to the \code{format} specifier.
}
\description{
The \code{CFts} instance contains a vector of offsets from an origin. This
function generates a vector of character strings that represent the date
and/or time in a selectable combination for each offset.
}
\details{
The character strings use the format \verb{YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssÂ±hh:mm}, depending
on the \code{format} specifier. The date in the string is not necessarily
compatible with \code{POSIXt} - in the \verb{360_day} calendar \code{2017-02-30} is valid
and \code{2017-03-31} is not.
}
\examples{
datum <- CFdatum("hours since 2020-01-01")
ts <- CFts(datum, seq(0, 24, by = 0.25))
x <- CFtimestamp(ts, "timestamp")
}
